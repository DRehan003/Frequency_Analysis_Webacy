<h1> Frequency And Correlation Analysis of Smart Contract Vulnerabilities </h1>

Essential Terminology:
- __Smart Contract__: A self-executing program  stored on blockchain that automatically carries out an agreement when certain conditions are met without needing a middleman. <br>
  - For Example: <br>
    Let’s say you want to buy a digital artwork. A smart contract can be set up so that as soon as you send the payment, the artwork is automatically transferred to you. No need for a 
    third party like PayPal or a bank.
  - Smart contracts use cases are ever growing. They can be even used for something as simple as a pair of friends making a bet on which team will win a sports game.
   - Why Are They Important? <br>
     - No Middlemen → No banks, lawyers, or companies needed to enforce the contract
     - Transparent → Everyone can see how the contract works (no hidden rules)
     - Secure & Immutable → Once written on the blockchain, it can’t be changed or tampered with
  <br>
- __Risk Tag__: Think of risk tags like warning labels on food—they alert you to potential dangers before you interact with a wallet or contract. These risk tags are provided by Webacy, a company that provides a security platform that helps protect crypto and NFT assets. There are a total of 32 risk_tags that we will be using. Each risk tag represents a different type of risk.
  - What do they detect?
    - Risks of a contract taking your funds through scam, hacks, or fraud
    - Hacking of your tokens
    - Suspicious activity such as involvement in shady transactions
    - Fake contracts mimicking legit ones

<h1> Part 1: Frequency Analysis </h1>

Objective: Document the occurrence rates of each risk tag across the dataset, providing a clear quantification of the most prevalent vulnerabilities. <br>

<h2> Frequency Analysis in Excel </h2>

<h3> Step 1: Convert all the True and False values to boolean values (1 or 0) </h3>

We do this so that can turn words into numbers and therefore make it easier to calculate how many smart contracts is labeled with a particular risk tag.




<h1> Part 2: Correlation Analysis </h1>

Objective: Create a visual representation of the correlation matrix to highlight potential relationships between different risk tags. <br>

<h1> Conclusion </h1>

How did the frequency and correlation findings provide actionable insights into improving smart contract security? Include potential implications for preventive measures and the prioritization of security efforts. <br>
